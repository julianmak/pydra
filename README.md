# pydra

Some analysis codes to deal with "hydra" data, written in python

"hydra" is a collective name for the CASL/CLAM codes and configurations by 
David Dritschel (Mathematics, St. Andrews), a semi-Lagrangian + pseudo-spectral code for 
doing high-Reynolds number fluid simulations (dissipation is through the contour surgery procedure). 

The codes here mostly deal with the "two-layer QG channel" configuration, existing only because 
I like certain things to be done on the fly rather than through a Fortran interface (cf. the reason for pyCDFTOOLS with NEMO data)

# To do:
- [ ] upload the adapted and relevant CASL/CLAM routines
- [ ] upload python scripts / notebooks

# key updates:
* 10 Apr 2018 -- opening of repository in anticipation of translating some codes
