Misc dump:

* try using f2py to wrap the basic inversion functions, but do the post-analysis
  in python
      
  ?? not sure what happens with constants and so forth, check this
     
  ?? still need to add in which variables are in/out/both...
  
  -- f2py works on the laptop
     -- from terminal it is something like
     
     f2py -m $MODULE_NAME -c $FILES_TO_INCLUDE
     
     which spits out "MODULE_NAME.so"
     
     -- e.g. "invert" subroutine in module "spectral" in spectral.f90 is
     
     from MODULE_NAME import *
     spectral.invert()
     
     and so forth
     
     -- e.g. MODULE_NAME.so compiled with "spectral" and "generic" would have
     
     MODULE_NAME.spectral
     MODULE_NAME.generic
     
     and appropriate subfunctions

* started on a native translation of the relevant routines in hydra (Fortran)
  into python
  -- need to work out what variables are in, out or in/out!
  -- BE CAREFUL OF INDEXING!
  -- reduce the number of loops if possible
